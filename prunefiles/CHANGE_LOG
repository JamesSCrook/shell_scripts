v2.0.0 - Fri 12 Sep 2025 13:46:14 AEST
    Initial git version
    Note: the reason for starting with 2.0.0 is because prunefiles has been used for many years, but
    with much less capability. The basic concept was the same, but:
    - The use of findfiles was mandatory (using find was not allowed)
    - There was no DELIMITER_STRING (the first argument had to be directory [pattern] without whitespace)
    - Directory and file names with (many) special characters were not supported.
    Therefore, findfiles v2.0.0 was born.
