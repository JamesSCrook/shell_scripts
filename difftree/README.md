# difftree

See
[https://yosj.com.au/staff/shell_scripts/difftree/difftree.php](https://yosj.com.au/staff/shell_scripts/difftree/difftree.php)
for details.

difftree compares trees of files. It's a bit like a cut-down (GNU) diff -r, but with a couple of twists.

There are two main reasons to use difftree:
1. You don't have GNU diff
2. You prefer difftree's output to GNU diff's
