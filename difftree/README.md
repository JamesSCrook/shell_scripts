# difftree

See
[https://yosj.com.au/staff/shell_scripts/difftree/difftree.html](https://yosj.com.au/staff/shell_scripts/difftree/difftree.html)
for details.

difftree provides essentially the same functionality as (GNU) diff -r.

There are two main reasons to use difftree:
1. You don't have GNU diff
2. You prefer difftree's output to GNU diff's
