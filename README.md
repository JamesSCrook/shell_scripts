# multx

Please refer to the github-pages link: [https://jamesscrook.github.io/multx](https://jamesscrook.github.io/multx)

But, very briefly, multx is a \*nix shell script that executes the same command(s) on multiple
\*nix hosts - either sequentially (syncronously) or in parallel (asynchronously).

multx is particularly useful for executing commands on multiple \*nix hosts but you don't have
access to a working configuration management tool that you know how to use.

There are two other support shell scripts to start and stop ssh-agent so multx can be used without typing passphrases (or passwords).
