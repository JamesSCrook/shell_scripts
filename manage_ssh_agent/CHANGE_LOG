As of Fedora 35, ssh-agent no longer has init (1) as its PPID
The fear is that this may spead elsewhere, so the test for this was removed.



start-ssh-agent:
    v1.0.4	Removed the check for PPID == 1, and other minor tidying

stop-ssh-agent:
    v1.0.3	Removed the check for PPID == 1, and other minor tidying
