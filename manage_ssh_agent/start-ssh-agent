# This script checks to see if ssh-agent is already running. If it's not, it
# prompts for a passphrase (you _should_ use one!) and then starts ssh-agent.
# Irrespective of whether ssh-agent was just started or had already been
# running, this script sets up the environment so that ssh-agent is useful.

# Do not _execute_ this script, "dot it".
